                “Dead Poets Society” is one of the important films that changed the lives of most people after watching. 
                <br>A great criticism and cynical rebellion against to system.
            </h5>
            <h6>
                Come my friends, 
                <br> It is not too late to seek a newer world…
                <br> for my purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset…
                <br> and though we are not now that strength which in old days
                <br> Moved earth and heaven,
                <br> That which we are, we are; one equal temper of heroic hearts,
                <br> Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
                <br> To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield!
                <br> — Alfred Lord Tennyson
            </h6>
            <h5>
                Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence
                <br> Some people say there are the four basic dynamics of a successful life. Stay with your traditions, act honorable, live
                <br> disciplined and be perfect. Same beliefs were ruling in Welton High School. A rigid education system and teachers like
                <br> robots… There is just one aim; To train important people who will have successful careers. Except one teacher, John
                <br> Keating; the most wonderful teacher I have ever seen.
